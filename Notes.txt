Milestone:
Solve orbit of rocket at L2 point over 1 lunar orbit. Use both Taylor expansion & RK or SciPy.
Find optimal value of delta r (distance between L2-Moon) to error < 1% and plot orbit of
Moon & rocket. Determine separation of rocket-Moon after 1 orbit.

- adaptive step size methods: Romberg's Method and RKF Method
- 

Extension:
Galaxy collisions
- gas interactions -> fluid dynamics
- separation of the DM halo
- Approximation that M_dm >> M_stars?
- Initial population of disk according to observed distribution -> k1*exp(-z/z0)*k2*exp(-r/r0)
