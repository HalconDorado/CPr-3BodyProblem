Broad objectives:
- Recreate Colombo et. al. result
- Long term integration
- N-body problem (include natural satellites other than Mimas)
    - Major moons group i.e. moons that have collapsed into spherical objects (listed in ascending semi-major axis)
    - Unrestricted N-body problem?
- Non-circular satellite orbits

Tips:
- Dictionary with orbital elements
- Difference in ring positions upon addition of extra bodies
- 

- Problem Statement
- Simulation of ring stability over long perdiods
- Demonstration of accuracy
    - Comparison of ring profiles with real-life rings

To-do:
- Read literature on previous findings
    - Colombo et. al. 1968
        - Restricted 3BP using Saturn-Mimas-Ring particle
        - Assumption of circular orbit for Mimas
        - Rotating coordinate system
    - Introduction to Astrodynamics
        - Oscullation p. 32-34
