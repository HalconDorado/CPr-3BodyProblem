    - Major moons group i.e. moons that have collapsed into spherical objects (listed in ascending semi-major axis)
    - Unrestricted N-body problem?
- Non-circular satellite orbits
- Oblateness of Saturn and Precession of ring particle orbits

### Tips:

Objective of the paper: See if the positional features (structure) of Saturn's rings can be explained by perturbations with its moons. 
- Restricted 3BP using Saturn-Mimas-Ring particle
- Assumption of circular orbit for Mimas
- Rotating coordinate system
- Titan also included as a second perturbatory body
- Unstable zone width of ~20km
- Model focuses on a system in which collisions no longer occur and use quantities associated with the perturbation of the ring orbits to calculate what ring profile is required so this condition is fulfilled.
